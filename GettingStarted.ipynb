    "# Welcome to \"NLP in VW\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to get you comfortable with using `vw` for basic NLP tasks, like binary classification. We will explore some of the `vw` options that are particularly useful for language problems and then future notebooks will go beyond binary classification. The topics we'll cover are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [What is binary classification?](#binary)\n",
    "* [Constructing a data set](#data)\n",
    "* [Running vw](#run)\n",
    "* [Multiple passes over the data](#passes)\n",

    "# <a id='binary'></a> What is Binary Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of a binary classifier is to learn to map inputs (usually called $\\mathbf x$) to binary labels (usually called $+1$ and $-1$). A simple example is sentiment classification. Given some text (perhaps a movie review), determine whether the overall sentiment expressed by that review is positive or negative toward the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a machine learning application, this mapping is **induced** from training data. The training data consists of a (hopefully large!) set of labeled examples: movie reviews **paired** with the correct label (positive or negative). The classic data set for this is from [Pang and Lee](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/); this is the data we will work with later. For comparison purposes, it's worth keeping in mind that the best performance Pang and Lee achieve on this data in their [2004 paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/cutsent.pdf) that introduced it is about 13% error. In this tutorial we'll get 15% error, and in the [subsequent tutorial](GettingTheMost.ipynb) will get 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the classifier (mapping from review to sentiment) has been learned, we can apply it to new reviews that are missing ratings to predict what the rating probably would have been. We usually care about the **accuracy** of this classifier: what percentage of predictions did it get wrong. Of course, we want to be able to measure this accuracy, so we hold out some test data on which to evaluate the classifier.\n",

    "\n",
    "This format is quite flexible, and we'll see additional fun things you can do later, but for now, the basic file format is one-example per line, with the label first and then a vertical bar (pipe) and then all of the features. If we're doing bag of words representation (a good starting point for text data), the features are just each-of-the-individual-words-in-the-text. For example, for the two above files, we'd want to create two `vw` examples like:\n",

At every $2^k$th example (examples 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...), it prints out a status update. This way you get lots of updates early (as a sanity check) and fewer as time goes on. The third column gives you the example number. The fourth column tells you the total \"weight\" of examples so far; right now all examples have a weight of 1.0, but for some problems (e.g., imbalanced data), you might want to give different weight to different examples. The fifth column tells you the true current label (+1 or -1) and the sixth column tells you the models' current prediction. Lastly, it tells you how many features there are in this example.\n",

    "The first two columns deserve some explanation. In \"default\" mode, `vw` reports \"progressive validation loss.\" This means that when `vw` sees a training example, it *first* makes a prediction. It then computes a loss on that single prediction. Only after that does it \"learn\". The average loss computed in this was is the **progressive validation loss.** It has a nice property that it's a good estimate of test loss, *provided you only make one pass over the data*, **and** it's efficient to compute. The first column tells you the average progressive loss over the *entire* run of `vw`; the second column tells you the average progressive loss *since the last time `vw` printed something*.\n",

    "The first issue is that one of the main speed bottlenecks for `vw` is file IO. Reading, and parsing, your input data is incredibly time consuming. In order to get around this, when multiple passes over the data are requested, `vw` will create and use a **cache file**, which is basically a second copy of your data stored in a `vw`-friendly, efficient, binary format.

    "* `-c`: this tells `vw` to automatically create and use a cache file; `vw` constructs this cache file in `foo.cache` where `foo` is the name of your input data (in the `vw` header it informs you that it's creating a file called `data/sentiment.tr.cache` for caching)\n",
    "* `-k`: by default, if `vw` uses a cache file, it *first* checks to see if the file exists. If the cache file already exists, it completely ignores the data file (`sentiment.tr`) and *just* uses the cache file. This is great if your data never changes because it makes the first pass slightly faster. However, I often change my data between `vw` runs and it's *really* annoying to spend two hours debugging only to find out that `vw` is ignoring the new data in favor of it's old cache file. `-k` tells `vw` to \"kill\" the old cache file: even if it exists, it should be recreated from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Warning: if you're running multiple jobs on the same file in parallel, you will get clashes on the cache file. You should either create a single cache file ahead of time and use it for all jobs [remove `-k` in that case], *or* you should explicitly give your own file names to the cache by saying `--cache myfilename0.cache` instead of `-c`.)\n",

That's because on the second pass, you'll already have trained on all the training data, so your model is going to be exceptionally good at making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`vw`'s default solution to this is to holdout a fraction of the training data as validation data. By default, it will hold out **every 10th example** as test. The holdout loss (signaled by the `h`) is then the average loss, *limited to these 10% of the training examples*.

    "Here, you can see that (a) `vw` can read data from standard input (in this case, the `head` of the test data), and can produce output to `/dev/stdout`. Because we ran in `--quiet` mode, all we got were the predictions. And note these are the same predictions as before: `vw` isn't cheating by looking at the correct label when it's in `-t` (test) mode.\n",
